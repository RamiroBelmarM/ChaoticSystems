A total of 188 tests (some of the 15 tests actually consist of multiple sub-tests)
were conducted to evaluate the randomness of 1000 bitstreams of 1048576 bits from:

	dat.dat

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The numerous empirical results of these tests were examined to interpret the
proportion of sequences that passes a statistical test
(proportion analysis) and the distribution of p-values to check for uniformity
(uniformity analysis). The results were the following:

	158/188 tests passed successfully both analyses.
	30/188 tests did not pass successfully both analyses.

Here are the results of the single tests:

 - The "Frequency" test FAILED both analyses.

 - The "Block Frequency" test FAILED both analyses.

 - The "Cumulative Sums" (forward) test FAILED both analyses.
   The "Cumulative Sums" (backward) test FAILED both analyses.

 - The "Runs" test FAILED both analyses.

 - The "Longest Run of Ones" test passed both analyses.

 - The "Binary Matrix Rank" test FAILED the proportion analysis.

 - The "Discrete Fourier Transform" test FAILED the proportion analysis.

 - 129/148 of the "Non-overlapping Template Matching" tests passed both analyses.
   19/148 of the "Non-overlapping Template Matching" tests FAILED the proportion analysis.

 - The "Overlapping Template Matching" test passed both analyses.

 - The "Maurer's Universal Statistical" test FAILED both analyses.

 - The "Approximate Entropy" test FAILED both analyses.

 - 8/8 of the "Random Excursions" tests passed both analyses.

 - 18/18 of the "Random Excursions Variant" tests passed both analyses.

 - The "Serial" (first) test FAILED both analyses.
   The "Serial" (second) test FAILED both analyses.

 - The "Linear Complexity" test passed both analyses.

The missing tests (if any) were whether disabled manually by the user or disabled
at run time due to input size requirements not satisfied by this run.
