Here you find the repository of the above mentioned paper:

The repository is organized as follows:

```terminal
Chaos
    |- Chaotic_systems  <- for the chaotic systems simulations
        |- Subfolder     <- chaotic system folder 
            |- cpp code     <- code implementation
            |- results.txt  <- Results of the NIST-STS presented in  the paper.
    |- TJF      <- folder of the TJ-Function implementation and application
        |- Core     <- the hard of TJF
        |- Folders for every TJF variation (Pnt, Hnt, Tnt, Unt)
            |- Plot folder      <- TJF plot
            |- 01-test folder   <- Chaos test 
            |- Cipher folder    <- Application of TJF in a cipher algorithm 
            |- Attractor folder <- Attractor reconstruction
            |- Nist             <- NIST-STS for the TJF variant
